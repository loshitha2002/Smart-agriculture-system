# Professional Training Checklist

## Pre-Training Validation:
- [ ] All disease classes have 50+ images
- [ ] Images are high resolution (800x600+)
- [ ] Clear disease symptoms visible
- [ ] Multiple plant varieties included
- [ ] Good lighting and focus quality
- [ ] No duplicate or near-duplicate images

## Training Configuration:
- [ ] Use EfficientNetB3 or ResNet50V2 architecture
- [ ] Set epochs to 50-100 for professional results
- [ ] Enable data augmentation
- [ ] Use validation split (20%)
- [ ] Configure early stopping
- [ ] Save best model weights

## Training Commands:
```bash
# Professional training (2-3 hours)
python train_disease_model.py --data_dir training_dataset --epochs 75 --model EfficientNetB3 --batch_size 16

# Alternative faster training (1 hour)
python train_disease_model.py --data_dir training_dataset --epochs 50 --model ResNet50V2 --batch_size 32
```

## Post-Training Validation:
- [ ] Training accuracy > 95%
- [ ] Validation accuracy > 90%
- [ ] No significant overfitting
- [ ] Test on new images
- [ ] Validate confidence scores
- [ ] Check confusion matrix

## Deployment:
- [ ] Copy trained model to backend
- [ ] Update class names file
- [ ] Restart ML server
- [ ] Test disease detection in web app
- [ ] Validate with real field images

## Expected Performance:
- Medical-grade accuracy (90%+ validation)
- Reliable confidence scores
- Professional disease recommendations
- Suitable for agricultural guidance
